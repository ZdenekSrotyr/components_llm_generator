# Rename headers processor

Takes all tables in `in/tables/` and renames specified columns in specified tables. Result is moved to `out/tables/` All
other tables that are not specified or columns that are not specified are moved unchanged.

Files folder `in/files` is moved unchanged.

Manifest files are respected and transferred / modified as well.

**Table of contents:**

[TOC]

## Configuration

list table names in parameters and list columns to rename, all others are kept

```
"test.csv": {
          "column_mapping": {
            "Column_1": "New_name_col_1"
          }
```

**NOTE**: Simple `*` wildcard is supported at the end of table name, e.g.:

```
"te*": {
          "column_mapping": {
            "Column_1": "New_name_col_1"
          }
```

The above will rename columns in table `test.csv`.

### Sample configuration

```json
{
  "definition": {
    "component": "kds-team.processor-rename-headers"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "test.csv": {
      "column_mapping": {
        "Column_1": "New_name_col_1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Development

This example contains runnable container with simple unittest. For local testing it is useful to include `data` folder
in the root and use docker-compose commands to run the container or execute tests.

If required, change local data folder (the `CUSTOM_FOLDER` placeholder) path to your custom path:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./:/code
      - ./CUSTOM_FOLDER:/data
```

Clone this repository, init the workspace and run the component with following command:

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org:kds_consulting_team/kds-team.processor-rename-headers.git my-new-component
cd my-new-component
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm dev
```

Run the test suite and lint check using this command:

```
docker-compose run --rm test
```

# Testing

The preset pipeline scripts contain sections allowing pushing testing image into the ECR repository and automatic
testing in a dedicated project. These sections are by default commented out.

# Integration

For information about deployment and integration with KBC, please refer to
the [deployment section of developers documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/component/deployment/)

Takes all tables in `in/tables/` and renames specified columns in specified tables. Result is moved to `out/tables/` All
other tables that are not specified or columns that are not specified are moved unchanged.

Files present in folder `in/files` are moved unchanged.

Manifest files are respected and transferred / modified as well.


## Configuration

### Sample configuration

```json
{
  "definition": {
    "component": "kds-team.processor-rename-headers"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "test.csv": {
      "column_mapping": {
        "Column_1": "New_name_col_1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

List table names in parameters and list columns to rename, all others are kept

```
"test.csv": {
          "column_mapping": {
            "Column_1": "New_name_col_1"
          }
```

**NOTE**: Simple `*` wildcard is supported at the end of table name, e.g.:

```
"te*": {
          "column_mapping": {
            "Column_1": "New_name_col_1"
          }
```

The above will rename columns in table `test.csv`.
